# Predicting-Big-Mart-Sales-Using-Machine-Learning-Model

## Project Overview

Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for the company to optimize inventory management, supply chain planning, and pricing strategies.
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts Big Mart sales for various product categories and stores, using historical data and other relevant factors.
The model will be able to accurately forecast sales for a given period, enabling Big Mart to make informed decisions about inventory management and resource allocation.

## Methodology

1.	Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.
2.	Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant patterns and relationships in the data
3.	Model selection: Evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the most effective one.
4.	Model training: Training the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5.	Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics.

## Results

The analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based predictive model can accurately predicts Big Mart sales for various product categories and stores, using historical data and other relevant factors. with accuracy level of 87%
